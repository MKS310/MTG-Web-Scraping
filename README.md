# MTG-Web-Scraping

[The Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MKS310/MTG-Web-Scraping/beautiful_soup_demo.ipynb) for this project was created as a demo of the web scraping portion.
I gave this demo to the Python Users Group at my corporate job to demonstrate some web scraping ideas.

There is a pdf file in this repo that can be downloaded for insight into the NLP side of this analysis.
